# BarnSight 

**BarnSight** builds practical, computer-vision tools that help farmers keep barns cleaner, safer, and more efficient.

We focus on **real-time detection of visible animal excrement** using edge AI and mobile-friendly systems — turning routine hygiene checks into fast, reliable, data-driven workflows.

## 🚀 What We Do

At **BarnSight AI**, we design and deliver:

- 📷 **AI-powered visual detection** of animal excrement in farm environments  
- ⚡ **Edge-first computer vision systems** optimized for low latency
- 🧠 **Well-documented, maintainable code** for long-term reliability  

Our systems assist farmers and inspectors — they don’t replace human judgment, they sharpen it.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Farms are harsh environments.  
Connectivity is unreliable.  
Users are busy.

So we build software that is:

- Robust under poor lighting and messy conditions  
- Fast enough for real-time scanning  
- Simple enough to use without training  
- Honest about limitations  

No gimmicks. Just tools that work.
